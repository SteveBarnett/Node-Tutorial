# Setup Node JS

## Installing Node JS

On Ubuntu you can install Node JS from the command line using `apt-get`.

You should already have it installed on your laptop if you completed the codeX intro.

The installation instructions are as follows:

* `sudo apt-get install node-legacy` (this will instal Node as `node` and the `nodejs` command)
* `sudo apt-get install npm`

Open a terminal window:

* Type `nodejs` and press enter. You should now be in a Node JS console. You can use Ctrl+C to get out of it.
* Type `npm` you should see some information about npm on the console.

Now you are ready to use JavaScript from the command line.

## Node JS Javascript from the command line

Let's run a simple JavaScript script from the command line:

* Create a file called `hello.js`.
* Copy this text into the file: `console.log('hello world!');`.
* Save the file.
* Now run it using `nodejs hello.js`.
* What happens?

So what just happened? You liberated your JavaScript knowledge from the command line.

Now prove this to yourself and write some JavaScript that uses:

* an `if` statement;
* a `for` loop;
* a simple function;
* whatever else you need to get comfortable.

If you can, create about 5 different JavaScript (.js) files to get more comfortable with JavaScript on the command line.

You can run the scripts using `nodejs filename.js`.
