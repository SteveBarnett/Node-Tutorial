# Filter some numbers

Change the program that is in the [filter-numbers.js](filter-numbers.js) file to only print the even numbers in the list to the console. You are not allowed to change the `console.log` statement.

Run the program from the command line using: `node filter-numbers.js`.

Run `mocha` from the command line. At least two tests should pass at this stage.

Now get going and [print some users](/node-tutorial/print.html) to the console.
